What the hell was all that. What shot them down anyway.
1 I have no idea. Mostlikely some rebel group. 
Maybe C3 or ISIZ when you consider the area. This is Northern Germany.
5 So now that we have them were should we go now. They are injured.
1 No regular hospital will do with the damage they've taken. We need to get them
to another CWG Group Op Center.
5 Wheres the nearest one?
1 The closest one I think is in Copenhagen. It belongs to the 3rd CWG Group.
5 Great....
1 What
5 Nothing is just that I have some ties with that group that arent exactly good.
1 Well time to burry the hatchet.
5 Forget the Hatchet, theyll burry me.
1 Ahh so thats how it is.
5 Yeah thats how it is.
1 Well weather you like it or not were going.
2 Hey I have a question.
1 What
2 How did you and alison meet?
5 We dont talk about it. More specifically pax doesnt.
1 I can make an exeption. Just this once....

PAX 

Me and Ali first met on the opening days of the war. I was a fighter pilot for
the 320th fighter group. She worked in special ops. It was Jun 12 my birthday.
My real birth day. I was in a flight of 8 given the position of flight lead.
Around 8am we were flying to Krassia to start the opening attack on the countries
infrastructure and strategic positions for their military. The standard tactics.
It was my call to fly low to avoid radar....

I was sorely wrong.

We flew for 30minutes and suddenly we were attacked. They were every where.
Krassia had implimented its new anti stealth missles system and boy did they work.
We were pounce and force to scramble. I told them to stay calm but it seems they 
were falling one after another. After 12 minutes me and my EWO were the only ones
left in the air. She asked me if we could return. I foolishly decide that we should
proceed. Another 12minutes went bye and we were straved by a AAA vic.
The plane was shuddering, the controls were locked, every alarm possible was ringing 
in my head and it wouldnt stop. We were dropping. I made the quick dessision to eject.
When we punched out and landed I found her 20ft from my location....
One of the AAA round struck her and had blown half of her away....



She was my only really good friend...
My action caused her death. If I could go back I'd do it differently.


Well what am I to do now I thought. Im in the middle of an enemy country with no
way out or to get help immediately. So I realize that I have to find a means of 
transportaion. I grab a car and head back to the homefront. On my way I see 
soldiers taking a girl away from a car reck. The soldiers appeard to be taking 
her by force. I stopped and engaged the....

BOOOOOOOOOOOOOM

What the hell was that.

ahhh what the hell
